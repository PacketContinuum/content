## BaseIntegration Help

You need two pieces of information to successfully use this integration. Firstly, 
you need to determine the ip address of the capture system you wish to become part of 
XSoar. One way to do this is to log into system using 'ssh' and running the command 
'ip addr' to display interfaces with network connectivity. There should be one interface. Thereafter,
an access token needs to be created in order to gain access to the Resful API.
